# üß© Django RESTful API Development Project

## üìñ Overview

This project guides learners through the complete lifecycle of designing and implementing robust RESTful APIs using Django. From scaffolding a clean project structure to defining models, establishing relationships, and configuring scalable URL routing, the project emphasizes best practices that lead to maintainable and production-ready codebases.

Ideal for backend developers, this project serves as a foundation for mastering Django and prepares learners to build secure and scalable systems following modern architectural patterns.

## üéØ Project Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Scaffold a Django project using industry-standard practices.
- Define scalable data models with Django ORM.
- Establish one-to-many, many-to-many, and one-to-one relationships between models.
- Create modular Django apps.
- Configure clean and scalable URL routing with `path()` and `include()`.
- Structure your codebase for clarity and maintainability.
- Optionally implement APIs using Django REST Framework (DRF).
- Test APIs using Postman or Swagger.

## üìö Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this project, you will:

- Understand how to scaffold and configure a Django project correctly.
- Design relational database schemas based on feature requirements.
- Build and manage Django models and migrations confidently.
- Develop RESTful API endpoints using Django (or Django REST Framework).
- Organize code with reusable apps and maintain modular views and serializers.
- Adhere to Django‚Äôs conventions for readability and collaboration.
- Gain familiarity with testing and documenting APIs.

## üöÄ Key Implementation Phases

### 1. Project Setup and Environment Configuration

- Create and activate a virtual environment
- Install Django
- Scaffold project using:
  ```
  bash
  django-admin startproject myproject
  python manage.py startapp core
  `settings.py` Configuration
  ```

- Add core apps to `INSTALLED_APPS`
- Configure middleware as needed
- Enable CORS for frontend/backend communication
- Use environment variables for secrets and settings

## üóÇÔ∏è Defining Data Models

1. **Identify Core Models**
   - Examples: `User`, `Property`, `Booking`

2. **Define Models Using Django ORM**
   - Specify fields with appropriate types and constraints
   - Add default values and verbose names where needed

3. **Apply Migrations**
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
